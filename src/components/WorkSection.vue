            <p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">
              I was a designer in a LEGO robot-building contest, where my team and I built an innovative robot that performed various complex tasks. Our approach focused on both creativity and functionality, ensuring that the robot excelled in both aesthetic design and technical performance.

            <h4 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">My Role:</h4>
            <p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">
              As the lead designer, I was responsible for designing the robot's appearance, structure, and mechanics. I ensured that the design complemented the robot's functional needs while standing out in terms of creativity and innovation.

            <h4 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Challenges:</h4>
            <p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">
              One of the biggest challenges was balancing the aesthetics with functionality. The robot had to look appealing while being capable of performing tasks effectively. Additionally, time constraints and limited resources added extra pressure, but we managed to overcome these hurdles through teamwork and strategic planning.
            </p>
            <h4 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Outcome:</h4>
            <p class="text-gray-400">
              Our team did exceptionally well in the contest, receiving recognition for both the innovative design and the robotâ€™s performance. This experience honed my skills in problem-solving, teamwork, and creativity.
